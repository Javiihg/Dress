        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            n a world where people are surrounded by endless visual stimuli daily, the last thing I want is to create something that goes unnoticed.
            This is why I find joy in crafting visual effects that evoke emotion and try to improve every possible details of the composition. It's often the little things that make your day

            At the heart of my work is empathy. Keeping in mind that there's a complex, unique individual on the other side of the screen inspires me to adopt a multi-layered approach to create.
