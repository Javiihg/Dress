        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate interface designer with a love for typography, design and funcionality.
            In a world where people juggle countless products daily, the last thing I want is to create yet another hurdle.
            This is why I find joy in crafting playful micro-animations, try to improve every possible details of the design and humanizing interactions. It's often the little things that make your day.

            At the heart of my work is empathy. Keeping in mind that there's a complex, unique individual on the other side of the screen inspires me to adopt a multi-layered approach to design.
            When I'm not designing, I enjoy exploring deep house music and curating playlist for creative inspiration.
