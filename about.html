        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a 3D Designer passionate about creating new products, exploring form through fashion and bringing ideas to life with motion design.
            I'm driven by the challenge of designing objects that not only look good but also make sense visually and functioanally.
            Sometimes, it's the subtle gestures and movements that make something truly come alive.

        <p>
            At the heart of my work is empathy. Keeping in mind that there's a complex, unique individual on the other side of the screen inspires me to adopt a multi-layered approach to design.
        </p>
        <p>
            My workflow revolves around Blender and Houdini, tools that allow me to combine design and motion.
